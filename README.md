# Maze Solver – BFS & Dijkstra

An interactive maze-solving visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project demonstrates how Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra’s Algorithm
work step-by-step to find the shortest path in a grid-based maze.

#Algorithms Implemented

#Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores nodes level by level
- Guarantees shortest path in an unweighted grid
- Time Complexity: O(V + E)

#Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Uses distance relaxation to compute shortest paths
- Priority-based node exploration
- Time Complexity: O(V²) (array-based implementation)

# How to Use

1. Click on cells to create walls
2. Click "Set Start" and choose a starting cell
3. Click "Set End" and choose a destination cell
4. Select an algorithm (BFS or Dijkstra)
5. Click "Solve" to visualize the solution
6. Click "Reset" to clear the grid
